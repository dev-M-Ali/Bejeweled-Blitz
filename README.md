# Bejeweled-Blitz

A journey down memory lane to my first programming project from (almost) 4 years ago! ðŸŽ®

A match-3 puzzle game in C++, inspired by Bejeweled Blitz, with a little help(.h) from my professor. 

Looking back, this project taught me valuable lessons about code modularity and abstraction - though I still chuckle at all the magic numbers in my code!
